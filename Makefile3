# Add simple rules to the make file
# The rule says that the .o file depends upon the .c version 
# of the file and the .h files included in the DEPS macro. 
# The rule then says that to generate the .o file, make needs 
# to compile the .c file using the compiler defined in the CC macro. 
# The -c flag says to generate the object file, the -o $@ says 
# to put the output of the compilation in the file named on the 
# left side of the :, the $< is the first item in the dependencies 
# list, and the CFLAGS macro is defined as above.
